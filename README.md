QOrganizer
==========
QOrganizer - personal and business information organizer using AES-256 to encrypt user data.
QOrganizer is a lightweight personal and business data organizer.

By using Qt QOrganizer is multiplatform and AES-256 encryption is a great way to keep things private.
I would be very thankful for reporting every issue and sharing every useful tip.

Ready packages for Debian and source are available on Sourceforge.
